# vcoding-api
flask api for vcoding front end

Had a friend using hundreds of excel sheets as part of a data entry project.

Created this api and the react front end to automatically scrape the excel files for the relevant data, allow for easy category selection on the react interface, and track progress during data entry.

At the end it produces a completed excel document with all records for specific countries. 

Repo is an absolute mess. Bunch of unnecesarry files and I forgot to add the pyinstaller folders to git ignore. This was built to fix one problem so won't be relevant to anyone else in the world. Hopefully no one sees this and we're all good.

One of their colleagues wanted to use it for the same dataset (different countries though) so uploaded here so they could download it easily.
