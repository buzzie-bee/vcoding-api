# vcoding-api
flask api for vcoding front end

There was a project at the University of Liverpool to code hundreds of excel sheets as part of a data entry project.

I created this api and the react front end to automatically scrape the excel files for the relevant data, allow for easy category selection on the react interface, and track progress during data entry.

At the end it produces a completed excel document with all records for specific countries. 

Another colleague on the project wanted to use it for the same dataset (different countries though) so uploaded here so they could download it easily.

It's a bit of a hacky set up to quickly get it up and running, if the project had run for longer than a couple of weeks I would refactor the whole thing massively.
